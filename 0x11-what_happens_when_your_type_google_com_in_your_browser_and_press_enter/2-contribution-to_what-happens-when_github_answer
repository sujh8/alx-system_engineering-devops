Introduction: In the modern digital era, accessing websites has become a seamless experience for users. However, behind the scenes, a complex series of steps occur to deliver the requested web content. In this blog post, we will delve into the journey of a web request when you type “https://www.google.com" into your browser and press Enter. We’ll explore each step, from the initial DNS request to the final rendering of the web page, covering essential components like DNS, TCP/IP, firewall, HTTPS/SSL, load balancer, web server, application server, and database.

DNS Request: When you type “https://www.google.com" into your browser, the first step is resolving the domain name to an IP address. Your browser sends a DNS (Domain Name System) request to a DNS resolver, which may be provided by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) or a third-party DNS provider like Google DNS. The DNS resolver recursively queries authoritative DNS servers until it obtains the IP address corresponding to “www.google.com".
TCP/IP: With the IP address obtained from the DNS resolution, your browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the IP address using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. TCP ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of packets over the Internet.
Firewall: Before reaching the destination server, the packets traverse through various network devices, including firewalls. Firewalls act as a barrier between your network and external networks, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. They help protect against unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
HTTPS/SSL: In the case of accessing a secure website like Google (https://www.google.com), the communication between your browser and the server is encrypted using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol, which is facilitated by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security). This encryption ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data exchanged between the client and server.
Load Balancer: Large-scale websites like Google often employ load balancers to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple servers to ensure scalability, high availability, and optimal performance. Load balancers monitor server health, route requests to the least loaded server, and can perform SSL termination to offload cryptographic operations from servers.
Web Server: Upon reaching the destination server, the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) receives the HTTP request. It processes the request, retrieves the requested web resources (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.), and generates an HTTP response.
Application Server: For dynamic web applications, the web server may delegate certain tasks to an application server (e.g., Flask, Django). The application server executes application logic, interacts with databases, and generates dynamic content based on the user’s request.
Database: In cases where data retrieval or manipulation is required, the application server communicates with the database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). The database server retrieves, stores, and manipulates data as requested by the application server, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
Conclusion: The journey of a web request, from typing a URL to rendering a web page, involves a complex interplay of various components across the web stack. Understanding these components and their interactions is crucial for web developers, system administrators, and anyone involved in building or maintaining web applications. By unraveling the intricacies of the web request process, we gain insights into the robust infrastructure that powers the modern web.
